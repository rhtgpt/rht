Subject: Null Pointer Exception Due to Missing received_date in PO_RECEIPT Event for TO #400008102

Dear [Recipient's Name],

On July 17, TOMS received a PO_RECEIPT event from SIMS for Transfer Order #400008102. However, a Null Pointer Exception was encountered during processing due to the absence of the received_date field in the event payload.

As per our analysis, the received_date, which is a part of the shipment details, is a required field for successful processing. Its absence led to the failure of the event handling in TOMS.

Kindly review the source system logic for this event and ensure the received_date is included in future PO_RECEIPT events to prevent similar issues.

Please let us know once this has been addressed or if further clarification is needed.

Best regards,
