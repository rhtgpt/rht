1) What’s actually in GD_LOB_04 (top consumers)
SELECT owner, segment_type, segment_name, partition_name,
       ROUND(bytes/1024/1024,2) AS size_mb
FROM   dba_segments
WHERE  tablespace_name = 'GD_LOB_04'
ORDER  BY bytes DESC;

2) Map every LOB/LOBINDEX in GD_LOB_04 to its table & column

(includes partitioned and subpartitioned cases)

WITH seg AS (
  SELECT owner, segment_name, segment_type, partition_name, bytes
  FROM   dba_segments
  WHERE  tablespace_name = 'GD_LOB_04'
),
-- LOB data + LOB index (column-level)
lob_col AS (
  SELECT l.owner, l.table_name, l.column_name, l.segment_name AS lobseg, l.index_name AS lobix
  FROM   dba_lobs l
)
SELECT 
  s.owner,
  lc.table_name,
  lc.column_name,
  s.segment_type,
  s.segment_name,
  s.partition_name,
  ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024,2) AS size_mb
FROM seg s
LEFT JOIN lob_col lc
       ON (s.owner = lc.owner AND (s.segment_name = lc.lobseg OR s.segment_name = lc.lobix))
ORDER BY size_mb DESC;


If a row shows TABLE_NAME/COLUMN_NAME → that LOB (or its LOBINDEX) belongs to that table/column.

If TABLE_NAME is NULL → the segment in GD_LOB_04 is not a LOB of any table (could be some other object), or the owner/table isn’t what we expect.

3) If you only care about your table
WITH t AS (
  SELECT 'GD' owner, 'CIM_OFM_SMG6_LOGGING' table_name FROM dual
)
SELECT s.owner,
       l.table_name,
       l.column_name,
       s.segment_type,
       s.segment_name,
       s.partition_name,
       s.tablespace_name,
       ROUND(s.bytes/1024/1024,2) AS size_mb
FROM   dba_lobs l
JOIN   dba_segments s
       ON s.owner = l.owner
      AND s.segment_name IN (l.segment_name, l.index_name)
JOIN   t
       ON t.owner = l.owner AND t.table_name = l.table_name
WHERE  s.tablespace_name = 'GD_LOB_04'
ORDER  BY size_mb DESC;


If this returns zero rows, then your table’s LOBs/LOBINDEXes are not in GD_LOB_04; the growth is from another object.

4) Who else is using GD_LOB_04?
SELECT NVL(l.table_name, '(not a LOB of any table)') AS table_name,
       NVL(l.column_name, '-') AS column_name,
       s.owner,
       s.segment_type,
       ROUND(SUM(s.bytes)/1024/1024,2) AS total_mb
FROM   dba_segments s
LEFT JOIN dba_lobs l
       ON l.owner = s.owner
      AND s.segment_name IN (l.segment_name, l.index_name)
WHERE  s.tablespace_name = 'GD_LOB_04'
GROUP  BY s.owner, s.segment_type, l.table_name, l.column_name
ORDER  BY total_mb DESC;

5) Check recyclebin (dropped stuff still holding space)
SELECT owner, object_name, original_name, type, ts_name, space
FROM   dba_recyclebin
WHERE  ts_name = 'GD_LOB_04'
ORDER  BY space DESC;
-- If safe:
-- PURGE DBA_RECYCLEBIN;

6) If you suspect seed partition LOBs

(when auditing dates fall into the seed range)

-- See LOB subpartitions + their tablespaces for your table
SELECT lsp.table_owner, lsp.table_name, lsp.column_name,
       lsp.subpartition_name, lsp.tablespace_name
FROM   dba_lob_subpartitions lsp
WHERE  lsp.table_owner = 'GD'
  AND  lsp.table_name  = 'CIM_OFM_SMG6_LOGGING'
ORDER  BY lsp.column_name, lsp.subpartition_name;
