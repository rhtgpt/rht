Subject: Issue with PO_RECEIPT Event for TO #400008102 – Missing received_date in Payload

Dear [Recipient's Name],

On July 17, TOMS received a PO_RECEIPT event from SIMS for Transfer Order #400008102. During processing, a Null Pointer Exception was encountered because the received_date field—part of the shipment details—was missing in the event payload.

As a result of this missing data, the status for this TO in the TOMS Database remains "shipped" and has not been updated to "DELIVERED".

We kindly request that the source system team review this issue and ensure the received_date is included in future PO_RECEIPT events to prevent such discrepancies.

Please let us know once the root cause is addressed or if further details are required.

Best regards,
