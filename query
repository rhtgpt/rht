"LOB_DATA" CLOB
was defined without a specific LOB storage clause like:

sql
Copy code
LOB ("LOB_DATA") STORE AS ... TABLESPACE ...
That means Oracle will place the LOB segment according to default rules:

Same tablespace as the table (here OMIE_DATA_01), unless an explicit LOB clause overrides it.

It will be stored as a BASICFILE LOB by default (if not configured for SECUREFILE at DB level).

Attributes like ENABLE STORAGE IN ROW, CHUNK, RETENTION, etc., also use defaults unless specified.

✅ Answer
LOB_DATA will be stored in the table’s tablespace OMIE_DATA_01, because no separate LOB storage clause was given.
